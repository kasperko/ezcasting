# ezcasting
Casting website with the mission to make it easy for casting directors and background actors to find work.

Full CRUD application with functionality including profile creation, profile editing, logging in and out, and multiple views. Planning on adding filtering functionality soon. Written in JavaScript, using Handlebars JS, Express, Google OAuth, and MongoDB. Went with Handlebars to experiment with a new JavaScript library to see how it works and compares to React.
